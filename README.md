## Getting Started
Lets get started! This section will get you downloading Xcode, getting the code, and installing the neccessary packages.

## Part 0: Install [Xcode 🔨](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
![Xcode](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/ec/c9/ac/ecc9ac2c-b358-82a8-10e0-64ad24056772/Xcode.png/246x0w.png)

Xcode is the development environment for all iOS, MacOS, tvOS, watchOS projects, including applications, installers, extensions, etc.
It can be a little complicated, but it is an incredibly powerful tool and designed by developers like you. 

1. Download and install Xcode
2. Open the app (in your Applications) and wait for it to install tools

## Part 1: Swift ⭐️

Swift is an awesome language. First released in 2014, Swift has been cleaned, designed, tested, and optimized 5 times by developers
at Apple and by independent contributors. Swift became a open-source language soon after its release, and is now being actively developed
by regular developers who want to see the language they use to improve.

### 1. In the Xcode start window select "Get started with a playground".

This will allow you to experiment with Swift syntax outside the context of an application. A palyground is a great place to just try things out and quickly see what is happening in Swift. Code your algorithms, test your UI code, or just experiment with iOS libraries you are unfamiliar with.

### 2. Experiment with Swift
Explore the language

> Take a look at **[the Swift Programming Language book](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language-swift-4-0-3/id881256329?mt=11)** resource for a quick introduction to Swift.

## Part 2: iOS App dev 📱

### Step 1: Get the starter code

Cocoapods is a package manager for Xcode projects, and it is quite easy to use. 

1. Run `pod install` in your prefered terminal to install all the packages
2. Open "DALI Yak.xcworkspace" where the cocoapods are installed
